            <p>
              <strong>Ember is "agency first; product second."</strong> This
              means that the core of our business isn't built on a product that
              will fluctuate based on global social, economic, or market
              conditions. Those elements have very little influence on our core
              business foundation and that's what promotes an infinite lifecycle
              for Ember. Our Construct is driven by a cyclical triad of
              advisory, consulting, and product.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <span className="blue">Advisory</span> is the oxygen we
              breathe into every project.
              <br />
              The <span className="red">Consulting</span> is the heat we bring
              into the blockchain space.
              <br />
              The <span className="orange">Token</span> is our fuel that builds
              our momentum.
            </p>
            <p>
              These three combined "elements of fire" are what breathes life,
              energy, and traction into our company, team, product, and, most
              importantly, community. In the end, we aren't the Ember...
              <strong>you are</strong>.
