          consulting as we are driven by a greater purpose of truth and triumph.
          The Ember Token is coming and we are bringing it to the world on the
          backbone of refuge that will bring recovery to good people, and good
          projects. In the continually evolving blockchain ecosystem filled with
          bad actors, dark alleys, and smoldering fires, we are the hope. We are
          the constant. <strong>We are the Ember</strong>.
